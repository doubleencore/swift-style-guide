## What this document _is_

This document is intended to provide direction on the _writing of Swift code_. This includes topics such as indentation, whitespace, naming, organizing, etc.

## What this document is _not_

This document is _not_ intended to provide direciton on the writing of _apps_. It should not dictate solutions or recommend design patterns.

Additionally, this document is _not_ intended to dictate which parts of Swift should be used and which should not. It should not, for example, forbid the use of custom operators. This document _should_ make formatting suggestions for such features.
